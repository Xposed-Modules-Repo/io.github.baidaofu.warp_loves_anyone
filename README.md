# Warp Loves Anyone

[中文](README.zh-CN.md)

An Xposed module (libxposed API 102) that forces apps of your choice through the Cloudflare WARP tunnel, and makes the Cloudflare apps' dark mode follow the system setting.

## Features

- Force any package through WARP: blocks selected packages from being added to the VPN's disallowed applications list
- "Force proxy list" entry injected into the apps' Settings → Advanced → Connection options (native-style list with per-app remove, plus a multi-select app picker with icons)
- "Follow system theme" switch injected into Settings → Advanced; when on, the apps' dark theme toggle is managed by the system
- Scope: `com.cloudflare.onedotonedotonedotone`, `com.cloudflare.cloudflareoneagent`

## Requirements

- A libxposed-compatible framework with API 102 support (e.g. LSPosed 2.x+)

## Usage

1. Enable the module in LSPosed (scope is fixed to the two Cloudflare apps)
2. Manage the force proxy list inside the apps: Settings → Advanced → Connection options
3. Reconnect the VPN to apply the list

## Build

```bash
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

CI produces an unsigned APK; sign it before installing, e.g.:

```bash
apksigner sign --ks debug.keystore --ks-pass pass:android --key-pass pass:android \
    --out app-release.apk app-release-unsigned.apk
```
